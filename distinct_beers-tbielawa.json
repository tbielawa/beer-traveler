The top-fermenting ale yeast strain contributes to the floral and herbal flavor with a hint of fruit. The clean, malty body is derived from the pale and lightroasted caramel malt, adding both body and a light sweetness to complement the bitterness.

Share it with your family over the holiday dinner. Lay a few down, aging only helps a barley wine develop more class. At 11.1 % ABV (alcohol by volume) this fine ale will keep for years. Our expected maximum shelf-life is 2 to 3 years.

This process brings forth a rich sweetness from the malt that makes it well worth the effort. Samuel Adams Boston Lager® also uses only the finest of ingredients including two row barley, as well as German Noble aroma hops. The exclusive use of two row barley not only imparts a full, smooth body but also gives the beer a wide spectrum of malt flavor ranging from slightly sweet to caramel to slightly roasted. The Noble hops varieties, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, add a wide range of floral, piney and citrus notes, which are present from the aroma, through the flavor, to the lingering smooth finish. We take great pride in the Noble hops used in our beers. They are hand selected by Jim Koch and our other brewers from the world's oldest hops growing area. Among the world's most expensive, they cost twenty times as much as other hops.","created_at":"Sat, 21 Aug 2010 07:26:35 +0000","auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false,"rating_score":3.346},"brewery":{"brewery_id":157,"brewery_name":"Boston Beer Company","brewery_label":"https://untappd.s3.amazonaws.com/site/brewery_logos/brewery-SamuelAdams.jpg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"SamuelAdamsBeer","facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Samuel-Adams-for-the-love-of-beer/117341921610","url":"http://www.samueladams.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Boston","brewery_state":"MA","lat":42.3144,"lng":-71.1034}}},"Olde School (2011)":{"recent_created_at":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 00:51:40 +0000","rating_score":5,"first_had":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 00:51:40 +0000","count":1,"beer":{"bid":102823,"beer_name":"Olde School (2011)","beer_label":"https://untappd.s3.amazonaws.com/site/beer_logos/beer-OldeSchool2011_102823.jpeg","beer_abv":15,"beer_style":"American Barleywine","beer_description":"","created_at":"Fri, 25 Nov 2011 21:01:51 +0000","auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false,"rating_score":3.93},"brewery":{"brewery_id":459,"brewery_name":"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery","brewery_label":"https://untappd.s3.amazonaws.com/site/brewery_logos/brewery-DogfishHeadCraftBrewery_459.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"dogfishbeer","facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/dogfishheadbeer","url":"http://www.dogfish.com/"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Milton","brewery_state":"DE","lat":38.7776,"lng":-75.3099}}},"Brewmaster's Reserve":{"recent_created_at":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 00:22:18 +0000","rating_score":3,"first_had":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 00:22:18 +0000","count":1,"beer":{"bid":140532,"beer_name":"Brewmaster's Reserve","beer_label":"https://untappd.s3.amazonaws.com/site/assets/images/temp/badge-beer-default.png","beer_abv":0,"beer_style":"Saison / Farmhouse Ale","beer_description":"BK exclusive ","created_at":"Sat, 03 Mar 2012 12:18:51 +0000","auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false,"rating_score":0},"brewery":{"brewery_id":259,"brewery_name":"Brooklyn Brewery","brewery_label":"https://untappd.s3.amazonaws.com/site/brewery_logos/brewery-BrooklynBrewery_259.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"brooklynbrewery","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/thebrooklynbrewery","url":"http://brooklynbrewery.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Brooklyn","brewery_state":"NY","lat":40.7215,"lng":-73.9575}}},"Hop Wallop":{"recent_created_at":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 23:35:18 +0000","rating_score":3,"first_had":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 23:35:18 +0000","count":1,"beer":{"bid":3826,"beer_name":"Hop Wallop","beer_label":"https://untappd.s3.amazonaws.com/site/beer_logos/beer-victoryHopWallop.jpg","beer_abv":8.5,"beer_style":"Imperial / Double IPA","beer_description":"We celebrate the pioneering spirit of old Horace 'Hop' Wallop and those who dare mighty adventurous things in this vivid, robust ale.
